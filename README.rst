Varial is installed by cloning the git repository. In order to make it work in
your environment, you need to add the Varial base directory to the
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable and the bin directory to your ``PATH``
variable::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path-to-Varial>
   export PATH=$PATH:<path-to-Varial>/bin
